# Fire_Fighting_Robo
This project developed a compact firefighting robot designed to access narrow spaces and reach deep fire locations. It uses an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance and a flame sensor for fire detection. The robot can autonomously locate and extinguish fires from a safe distance.  A camera enables remote monitoring via a smartphone.
