# Fire_Fighting_Robo
This project involves a compact firefighting robot designed to operate in narrow spaces and access deeper fire locations, minimizing risks to firefighters. It is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance and three flame sensors positioned to detect fire in front, left, and right directions. The robot can be remotely controlled via Bluetooth or Serial commands to move forward, backward, left, right, or stop. Upon detecting flames, it triggers an LED alert and reports the flameâ€™s position through the control interface. A camera allows remote monitoring via a smartphone or other device, enabling the human operator to oversee operations while the robot autonomously identifies and extinguishes fires from a safe distance. The system is built on an Arduino microcontroller platform, using IR sensors for navigation assistance and multiple flame sensors for precise fire detection, ensuring reliable and responsive firefighting performance.
